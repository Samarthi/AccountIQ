- **Win over the right persona in your target company**: Automatically generates the relevant persona for a particular company and product and generates personalised email drafts for each.
- **Find the right target**: Choose a product and a location and you'll get a list of potential customers, their revenue, and their pain points.
- **Automate busywork**: Lets you export all your research to excel using AI. Just enter the format of the excel sheet once and NarrativeTailor will do the rest.
